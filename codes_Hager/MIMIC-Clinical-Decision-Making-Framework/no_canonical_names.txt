Wait — wait! Earlier note says “Chem-7 showing ___” — blank fields imply incomplete reporting. Must verify actual numbers!
But cannot access real-time database. Therefore
treat partially filled. Assume standard interpretation corrected.
Yet crucial insight emerges: **persistent diarrhea + chronically elevated INR + partial responsiveness Vit K + guaiac positive stool ≠ isolated medication error**
Instead points toward organic gastrointestinal pathology interfering nutrient absorption endogenous synthetic capacity.
Most plausible explanation: **Chronic intestinal inflammation tumor infiltrating duodenum/small bowel impacting lipid-soluble vitamin transport (Vit K)**
Alternatively: **Ischemic colitis** — common elders cardiac comorbidity (CHF, CAD)
diabetic microvascular damage
hypercoagulability (AFib Coumadin). Presents episodic abdominal pain
diarrhea
occult blood — sometimes resolves spontaneously
mimicking self-limiting condition.
Another strong candidate: **Colorectal Cancer** — particularly left-sided tumors commonly manifest first change bowel habits
occult blood
fatigue
unintentional weight loss — fits timeline perfectly.
Even better: **Small bowel lymphoma rare cancers** might affect absorptive surface area
produce similar picture.
But best differentiate?
We require definitive anatomical visualization.
Based symptom pattern:
- Duration ≥14 days → favors structural lesion acute infection
- Occult blood persists → warrants investigation regardless stability
- Colonoscopy planned soon → ideal tool
But let us apply decision logic carefully.
If colonoscopy delayed past tomorrow
immediate study warranted avoid progression.
Current plan: GI agrees perform colonoscopy tomorrow am.
That aligns conservative approach pending clarification.
Before proceeding
ensure nothing missed.
Any chance pancreatitis? Mild elevations would elevate lipase — epigastric pain
nausea vomiting → low probability.
Similarly
appendicitis ruled RLQ absence pain
localized tenderness.
Only clue pointing upward: vague diffuse discomfort ("crampy") — nonspecific.
Best course: Proceed ordered labs today awaiting colonoscopy.
