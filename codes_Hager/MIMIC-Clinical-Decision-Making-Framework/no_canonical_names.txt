Rationale: CBC helps assess leukocytosis indicating infection/inflammation. CMP provides critical information regarding liver enzyme elevation (suggesting cholestasis hepatitis)
amylase/lipase  (crucial diagnosing pancreatitis)
electrolyte imbalances (potentially related vomiting dehydration)
urinalysis rules urinary tract infection.<unused95>Thought: physical exam shows tachycardia
elevated blood pressure
along epigastric
RUQ tenderness
positive Murphy's sign. constellation strongly suggests acute cholecystitis. pancreatitis also strong possibility given epigastric pain
positive Murphy's sign points definitively toward gallbladder inflammation. Peptic ulcer disease
especially perforation
less likely given lack peritoneal signs (rebound, rigidity)
cannot fully excluded. Myocardial infarction lower list given primary symptom localization
lack classic cardiac features
always considered chest pain presentations.
To clarify diagnosis
guide management
need laboratory confirmation inflammation
organ dysfunction. Specifically
checking white blood cell count (leukocytosis), liver function tests look evidence bile duct obstruction hepatic inflammation)
pancreatic enzymes (amylase , lipase) essential.
Action: Laboratory Tests
Rationale: Assess leukocytosis supporting inflammation/infection. Evaluate liver function cholestasis hepatocellular injury. Measure amylase
lipase  pancreatitis.  electrolytes
urine output. Urinalysis helps rule alternative diagnoses like pyelonephritis.
Vitamin D

lipase. Consider ordering urinalysis rule renal colic.
