## Imaging

### LENIs (Lower Extremity Non-Invasive)

No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower extremity veins.

### CT Chest w/ and w/o Contrast

1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic abnormality.
2. Multiple pulmonary nodules, the largest of which measures 7 mm. If clinically indicated, follow-up chest CT is suggested at ___ months. If there is no change, a second follow-up in ___ months and then at 24 months is recommended if there is no change.
3. Dilated main pulmonary artery likely reflective of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
4. Markedly enlarged thyroid gland with mediastinal extension and severe narrowing of the trachea.
5. Mild centrilobular emphysema.

### CXR (Chest X-Ray)

1. Moderate pulmonary congestion and mild interstitial edema is increased, moderate right pleural effusion is new, and moderate left basilar atelectasis is increased since ___, consistent with acute CHF exacerbation. Large goiter, unchanged.

### Ankle X-Ray

No acute fracture or dislocation is detected about the left ankle. There is minimal spurring about the distal tibia, but no other evidence of tibiotalar joint osteoarthritis. The mortise joint is congruent, without talar dome OCD. There is prominent enthesophytic spurring along the posterior and inferior calcaneus. An ovoid density projects inferior to the fibula measures 5 mm, of unclear etiology, potentially sequelae of prior trauma. Differential diagnosis could include an early left, focus hydroxyapatite, or calcified lymph node. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is identified. Vascular calcifications are noted.

### CT Abdomen

1. No evidence of malignancy or metastatic disease within the abdomen or pelvis although residual high-density oral contrast and associated artifact moderately limits evaluation of the large bowel and pelvis.
2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
3. Intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary dilation, which may represent previous gallstone passage.
4. Extensive atherosclerosis and infrarenal abdominal aortic ectasia measuring maximally 31 mm.
5. Diverticulosis.

## Brief Hospital Course

___ y/o F with atrial fibrillation on warfarin, PE, CKD III, PVD, multinodular goiter s/p biopsy w/ possible follicular neoplasm in ___ who was sent to ___ ED after being found to have L jugular and subclavian venous thrombosis despite therapeutic INR on warfarin.

### Hypoxemia and Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure (Acute on Chronic)

Patient w/new O2 requirement, hx of OSA, and ABG was consistent with acute on chronic respiratory failure. Likely the patient's stenosis of her airway from large goiter contributing. Also, may have undiagnosed COPD given emphysematous changes on her CT scan along with untreated OSA. Her elevated bicarbonate is suggestive of a chronic process. She was transferred to the ICU on ___ for monitoring w/continuous O2 (88-92%) due to concerns about airway compression and increasing oxygen requirement shortly after her admission. ENT was consulted on ___ for evaluation of any airway compromise and did not feel that any intervention was warranted. She did not demonstrate any respiratory distress at any time during her hospital stay. She was transferred to the floor on the ___ and had continuous O2 monitoring. She also continued to use BiPAP with good effect at night. BiPAP settings were: EPAP 5, IPAP 15, O2 flow: 6.

### LUE DVTs

Patient w/new onset DVTs despite therapeutic warfarin. This is concerning for a coagulopathy. It is unclear if this is inherited or acquired perhaps in the setting of malignancy. No clear provoking symptoms. CT abdomen/pelvis was negative for overt malignancy or metastases. Imaging did show pulmonary nodules that will need to be followed up with repeat imaging. Also, there is concern for malignancy related to her multinodular thyroid. She is scheduled to follow up with her endocrinologist regarding this. She was placed on enoxaparin 80 mg q12hr per hematology recommendations. Hematology/Oncology was following her throughout admission as well.

### Gout

Patient had some left foot/ankle pain which impaired her ability to walk. It improved after colchicine administration. X-Ray of left foot was negative.

### Atrial Fibrillation

Has chronic atrial fibrillation, and warfarin was discontinued as she developed upper extremity DVTs with therapeutic INR. Lovenox was initiated. Amiodarone was at first discontinued in the ICU, and then restarted on the floor. She was discharged on her home dose of 100 daily. Her PR interval was >200 and she was not considered a good candidate for a beta blocker while in house.

### Coronary Artery Disease

Stable. Continued atorvastatin, aspirin.

### Hypertension

Stable. Continued home amlodipine, lisinopril.

### Thyroid Disease

Patient w/large goiter, and questionable effect on trachea. Followed by ___ endocrinology. IP and ENT at ___ will consider intervention pending whether there is malignancy within goiter, and overall patient prognosis. Methimazole was continued. Thyroglobulin pending at discharge. Abd/pelvic CT without evidence of malignancy.

### MGUS

Monoclonal IgG kappa represents only 1% of total protein. The rest of it, and IgA, are polyclonal. Free kappa and lambda light chains both slightly elevated, not worrisome for myeloma. No further evaluation needed.

---

## Transitional Issues

- She was followed by hem/onc as inpatient: PCP can refer her to Dr ___, ___ Heme, for further follow-up if deemed appropriate.
- For the PCP: IP can offer her a joint procedure with ENT regarding her large multinodular goiter and its impingement on the trachea when it is clear whether there is malignancy present or not, and what the overall prognosis of patient is. They can certainly stent her trachea if it starts to compromise her airway if that is within the patient goals of care. An appointment in interventional pulmonology/compromised ___ clinic is being made for her at ___ to follow up this issue.
- Multiple pulmonary nodules, the largest of which measures 7 mm. If clinically indicated, follow-up chest CT is suggested at ___ months. If there is no change, a second follow-up in ___ months and then at 24 months is recommended if there is no change.
- Repeat FNA in 2 weeks with endocrinology. Thyroglobulin pending at discharge.
- Nightly BiPAP: EPAP 5, IPAP 15, O2 flow: 6
- Patient started on Lovenox 80 mg SC BID for UE DVT which occurred while on warfarin
- Consider starting allopurinol for prevention of gout
- **HCP:** ___ (___) — ___
- **Code:** Full confirmed

Please keep your appointments with your urologist, endocrinologist, and primary care physician. You will also need to follow up with the lung doctors who were following you as an inpatient.
