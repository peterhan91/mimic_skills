## Clinical Guidelines: Appendicitis

### EAES Consensus 2015

## Antibiotic prophylaxis
Antibiotic prophylaxis has been proven effective in prevention of superficial surgical site infections and intra-abdominal abscesses in patients with appendicitis [bib_ref] Antibiotics versus placebo for prevention of postoperative infection after appendicectomy, Andersen [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] The use of pre-or postoperative antibiotics in surgery for appendicitis: a systematic..., Daskalakis [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Risk of surgical site infection and efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis: a cohort..., Kasatpibal [/bib_ref]. Prophylaxis should be commenced at the time of establishing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The choice of antibiotics is dependent on the local microbiome and drug resistance pattern and is not influenced by age.

## Post-operative antibiotics
The incidence of SSI after appendectomy has been reported to range from 0 to 11 % [bib_ref] Postoperative antibiotics correlate with worse outcomes after appendectomy for nonperforated appendicitis, Coakley [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Duration of antibiotic treatment after appendicectomy for acute complicated appendicitis, Van Rossem [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Rational use of antibiotic therapy after appendicectomy, Pinto [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Metronidazole and ticarcillin in the prevention of sepsis after appendicectomy, Ambrose [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Prophylaxis of infection after appendicectomy: a survey of current surgical practice, Campbell [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] A comparison of the prophylactic value of

### SIFIPAC/WSES Elderly 2019

## Could the diagnosis of acute appendicitis be based
only on clinical signs and symptoms in elderly patients?
In adult patients, laboratory tests of the inflammatory response and the clinical descriptors of peritoneal irritation and migration of pain are the strongest discriminators and should be included in the diagnostic assessment of patients with suspected appendicitis.
According to most included studies, among elderly patients, there is a lower rate of correct pre-operative diagnosis of acute appendicitis compared to younger population.
Furthermore, in almost all the included studies, the average time from symptoms onset to admission and from admission to theatre was greater in older patients than in younger ones.
There is still controversy on whether the presentation of appendicitis in the elderly patients differs significantly from those in the younger age groups.
According to some authorsthe typical triad of migrating right lower quadrant pain of short duration, fever and leucocytosis is infrequently observed. Many elderly patients with acute appendicitis have signs and symptoms consistent with ileus or bowel obstruction. Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, nausea and vomiting are common. The reported rate of the presence of fever ranges from 30 to 80%. However, only a minority of the patients has all of typical signs and symptoms together.
According to other authors, appendicitis does not present atypically in older patients. On the contrary, symptoms and signs

An imputed intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference in the incidence of postoperative infection rates: 17% (35 out of 207) in the no-treatment group compared with 15% (31 out of 207) in the antibiotic group (absolute difference 1.93%; 95% CI − 8. .
No studies were found on this topic since the publication of the 2016 WSES Guidelines on ACC.

### Tokyo Guidelines: Diagnostic Criteria

## Diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis
Diagnosis is the starting point of the management of acute cholecystitis, and prompt and timely diagnosis should lead to early treatment and lower mortality and morbidity. Specifi c diagnostic criteria are necessary to accurately diagnose typical, as well as atypical cases. The Guidelines propose diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis [fig_ref] Table 1: Diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis Imaging fi ndings [/fig_ref]. C-reactive protein (CRP) is not commonly measured in many countries. However, because acute cholecystitis is usually associatied with an elevation of CRP level by 3 mg/dl or more, CRP was included. Diagnosis of acute cholecystitis by elevation of CRP level (3 mg/dl or more), with ultrasonographic fi ndings suggesting acute cholecystitis, has a sensitivity of 97%, specifi city of 76%, and positive predictive value of 95% (level 1b). [bib_ref] Diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography and C-reactive protein concentration in acute cholecystitis: a..., Juvonen [/bib_ref] After the discussion during the Tokyo International Consensus Meeting, almost unanimous agreement was achieved on the criteria [fig_ref] Table 2: Answer pad responses on the diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis [/fig_ref]. However, 19% of the panelists from abroad expressed the necessity for minor modifi cations, because, in the provisional version, the diagnostic criteria did not include technetium hepatobiliery iminodiacetic acid (Tc-

### Tokyo Guidelines: Revised Criteria

## Assessment of tg07 diagnostic criteria and severity assessment criteria for acute cholecystitis
The 451 patients who were operated on for cholecystectomy comprised 255 male patients and 196 female patients with a mean age of 63.9 ± 14.0 years. 227 of the 451 patients enrolled were given a final pathological diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The prevalence of acute cholecystitis in the cohort was 50.3 %. Based on the diagnostic criteria in TG07, a definite diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was made in 224 patients. Diagnostic criteria were not met in the remaining 227 patients.
We constructed 2 9 2 contingency tables between pathologically proven acute cholecystitis and acute cholecystitis diagnosed by TG07 criteria. There were 209 truepositive cases, 15 false-positive cases, 18 false-negative cases, and 209 true

## Clinical Guidelines: Diverticulitis

### WSES 2020

## Should antibiotics be recommended in immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis?
In immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis without signs of systemic inflammation, we recommend to not prescribe antibiotic therapy (strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A).
In patients requiring antibiotic therapy, we recommend oral administration whenever possible, primarily, because an early switch from intravenous to oral therapy may facilitate a shorter inpatient length of stay (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B).
The definition of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is often vague and poorly defined. Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is defined as localized diverticular inflammation without any abscess or perforation. A universally accepted classification divides intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) into complicated and uncomplicated [bib_ref] The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines..., Sartelli [/bib_ref]. In uncomplicated IAIs, the infection only involves a single organ and does not extend to the peritoneum, while in complicated IAIs, the infectious process extends beyond the organ, causing either localized or diffuse peritonitis [bib_ref] The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines..., Sartelli [/bib_ref]. For a better definition of acute diverticulitis in these guidelines, we use the term complicated a

### NICE: Diverticular Disease

# Recommendations
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care, as described in your care.
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.

## Management and advice
Tell people with diverticulosis that the condition is asymptomatic and no specific treatments are needed.
Advise people to eat a healthy, balanced diet including whole grains, fruit and vegetables. Tell them that:
there is no need to avoid seeds, nuts, popcorn or fruit skins
if they have constipation and a low-fibre diet, increasing their fibre intake gradually may minimise flatulence and bloating.
Advise people to drink adequate fluid if they are increasing their fibre intake, especially if there is a risk of dehydration.
Consider bulk-forming laxatives for people with constipation.
Tell people about the benefits of exercise, and weight loss if they are overweight or obese, and stopping smoking, in reducing the risk of developing acute diverticulitis and symptomatic disease.
To find out why the committee made the recommendations on diverticulosis management and advice and how they might affect practice, see rationale and impact .

# Acute pancreatitis
People with acute pancreatitis usually present with sudden-onset abdominal pain. Nausea and vomiting are often present and there may be a history of gallstones or excessive alcohol intake. Typical physical signs include epigastric tenderness, fever and tachycardia. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed by testing blood lipase or amylase levels, which are usually raised. If raised levels are not found, abdominal CT may confirm pancreatic inflammation.

## Referral for specialist treatment
If a person develops necrotic, infective, haemorrhagic or systemic complications of acute pancreatitis:
seek advice from a specialist pancreatic centre within the referral network and
discuss whether to move the person to the specialist centre for treatment of the complications.
When managing acute pancreatitis in children:
seek advice from a paediatric gastroenterology or hepatology unit and a specialist pancreatic centre and
discuss whether to move the child to the specialist c

### JPN: Diagnostic Criteria

## It is essential to interview all patients (including those with consciousness disorders or who are in a state of shock), take their medical histories, and perform a physical examination (recommendation a)
Abdominal pain, pain radiating to the back, anorexia, fever, nausea and vomiting, and decreased bowel sounds are frequent manifestations of acute pancreatitis (Tables 1 and 2) (Level 4). 1,2 However, these features are not specific to acute pancreatitis, and when a patient presents with these manifestations, acute pancreatitis must be differentiated from other acute abdominal diseases. Acute pancreatitis accounts for 2% to 3% of all acute abdominal diseases (Level 2b, unknown) 3,4 and in a very few patients there is no abdominal pain (Level 2b). 5 tis are 85% to 100% and 84.7% to 99.0% (Level 2a), [bib_ref] Lipase and pancreatic amylase activities in tissues and in patients with hyperamylasemia, Apple [/bib_ref] respectively. The blood lipase value is more sensitive than blood amylase (Levels 2b-4) 11-13 and provides diagnostic capability similar to that of blood P-amylase (Level 2b). [bib_ref] Normal amylase levels in the presentation of acute pancreatitis, Orebaugh [/bib_ref] Blood lipase is considered a valuable diagnostic tool, because abnormally high values persist for longer than abnormal blood amylase levels (Level 2b), [bib_ref] Serum lipase: a better test to diagnose acute alcoholic pancreatitis, Gumaste [/bib_ref] and it is more sensitive in terms of detecting t

### JPN: Severity Assessment

## Severity assessment is essential to the selection of appropriate initial treatment. even acute pancreatitis that is initially diagnosed as mild or moderate may quickly progress to severe, and continuous assessment is required, particularly during the first 3 days after onset (recommendation a)
To improve the survival rate in patients with acute pancreatitis, severity assessment during the initial examination is extremely important to ensure the quick and accurate diagnosis of severe cases (which have a high mortality rate), to commence appropriate initial treatment, and, if necessary, to transfer the patient to an advanced specialist medical institution. Because quite a few cases initially diagnosed as mild acute pancreatitis may progress to severe acute pancreatitis, serial assessments of severity should be performed. It is
