## Clinical Guidelines: Appendicitis

### EAES Consensus 2015

## Antibiotic prophylaxis
Antibiotic prophylaxis has been proven effective in prevention of superficial surgical site infections and intra-abdominal abscesses in patients with appendicitis [bib_ref] Antibiotics versus placebo for prevention of postoperative infection after appendicectomy, Andersen [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] The use of pre-or postoperative antibiotics in surgery for appendicitis: a systematic..., Daskalakis [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Risk of surgical site infection and efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis: a cohort..., Kasatpibal [/bib_ref]. Prophylaxis should be commenced at the time of establishing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The choice of antibiotics is dependent on the local microbiome and drug resistance pattern and is not influenced by age.

## Post-operative antibiotics
The incidence of SSI after appendectomy has been reported to range from 0 to 11 % [bib_ref] Postoperative antibiotics correlate with worse outcomes after appendectomy for nonperforated appendicitis, Coakley [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Duration of antibiotic treatment after appendicectomy for acute complicated appendicitis, Van Rossem [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Rational use of antibiotic therapy after appendicectomy, Pinto [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Metronidazole and ticarcillin in the prevention of sepsis after appendicectomy, Ambrose [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Prophylaxis of infection after appendicectomy: a survey of current surgical practice, Campbell [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] A comparison of the prophylactic value of

## Could the diagnosis of acute appendicitis be based
only on clinical signs and symptoms in elderly patients?
In adult patients, laboratory tests of the inflammatory response and the clinical descriptors of peritoneal irritation and migration of pain are the strongest discriminators and should be included in the diagnostic assessment of patients with suspected appendicitis.
According to most included studies, among elderly patients, there is a lower rate of correct pre-operative diagnosis of acute appendicitis compared to younger population.
Furthermore, in almost all the included studies, the average time from symptoms onset to admission and from admission to theatre was greater in older patients than in younger ones.
There is still controversy on whether the presentation of appendicitis in the elderly patients differs significantly from those in the younger age groups.
According to some authorsthe typical triad of migrating right lower quadrant pain of short duration, fever and leucocytosis is infrequently observed. Many elderly patients with acute appendicitis have signs and symptoms consistent with ileus or bowel obstruction. Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, nausea and vomiting are common. The reported rate of the presence of fever ranges from 30 to 80%. However, only a minority of the patients has all of typical signs and symptoms together.
According to other authors, appendicitis does not present atypically in older patients. On the contrary, symptoms and signs
