## Antibiotic prophylaxis
Antibiotic prophylaxis has been proven effective in prevention of superficial surgical site infections and intra-abdominal abscesses in patients with appendicitis [bib_ref] Antibiotics versus placebo for prevention of postoperative infection after appendicectomy, Andersen [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] The use of pre-or postoperative antibiotics in surgery for appendicitis: a systematic..., Daskalakis [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Risk of surgical site infection and efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis: a cohort..., Kasatpibal [/bib_ref]. Prophylaxis should be commenced at the time of establishing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The choice of antibiotics is dependent on the local microbiome and drug resistance pattern and is not influenced by age.

## Post-operative antibiotics
The incidence of SSI after appendectomy has been reported to range from 0 to 11 % [bib_ref] Postoperative antibiotics correlate with worse outcomes after appendectomy for nonperforated appendicitis, Coakley [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Duration of antibiotic treatment after appendicectomy for acute complicated appendicitis, Van Rossem [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Rational use of antibiotic therapy after appendicectomy, Pinto [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Metronidazole and ticarcillin in the prevention of sepsis after appendicectomy, Ambrose [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Prophylaxis of infection after appendicectomy: a survey of current surgical practice, Campbell [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] A comparison of the prophylactic value of cefotetan and metronidazole appendectomy, Buckels [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Monotherapy versus multi-drug therapy for the treatment of perforated appendicitis in children, Nadler [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Duration of postoperative intravenous antibiotics in childhood complicated appendicitis: a propensity score-matched..., Yu [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Prophylaxis of postappendicectomy sepsis by metronidazole and ampicillin: a randomized, prospective and..., Lau [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Comparison of needlescopic appendectomy versus conventional laparoscopic appendectomy: a randomized controlled trial, Lau [/bib_ref]. The severity of appendicitis strongly influences the risk of developing post-operative complications resulting in a substantially higher complication rate (up to 2-4 times) in patients with complicated appendicitis. In this specific group, postoperative administration of antibiotics significantly reduces the rate of SSI. In addition, to reduce bacteraemia and sepsis, these patients are uniformly treated with a course of post-operative antibiotics [bib_ref] Postoperative antibiotics correlate with worse outcomes after appendectomy for nonperforated appendicitis, Coakley [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Duration of antibiotic treatment after appendicectomy for acute complicated appendicitis, Van Rossem [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Rational use of antibiotic therapy after appendicectomy, Pinto [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Metronidazole and ticarcillin in the prevention of sepsis after appendicectomy, Ambrose [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Prophylaxis of postappendicectomy sepsis by metronidazole and ampicillin: a randomized, prospective and..., Lau [/bib_ref]. In uncomplicated appendicitis, there is no evidence supporting routine administration of post-operative antibiotics. Therefore, only one pre-operative dose is advised [bib_ref] Postoperative antibiotics correlate with worse outcomes after appendectomy for nonperforated appendicitis, Coakley [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Duration of antibiotic treatment after appendicectomy for acute complicated appendicitis, Van Rossem [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Rational use of antibiotic therapy after appendicectomy, Pinto [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Metronidazole and ticarcillin in the prevention of sepsis after appendicectomy, Ambrose [/bib_ref].

## SIFIPAC/WSES Elderly 2019
*The SIFIPAC/WSES/SICG/SIMEU guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis in the elderly (2019 edition)* (pubmed)

## Could the diagnosis of acute appendicitis be based
only on clinical signs and symptoms in elderly patients?
In adult patients, laboratory tests of the inflammatory response and the clinical descriptors of peritoneal irritation and migration of pain are the strongest discriminators and should be included in the diagnostic assessment of patients with suspected appendicitis.
According to most included studies, among elderly patients, there is a lower rate of correct pre-operative diagnosis of acute appendicitis compared to younger population.
Furthermore, in almost all the included studies, the average time from symptoms onset to admission and from admission to theatre was greater in older patients than in younger ones.
There is still controversy on whether the presentation of appendicitis in the elderly patients differs significantly from those in the younger age groups.
According to some authorsthe typical triad of migrating right lower quadrant pain of short duration, fever and leucocytosis is infrequently observed. Many elderly patients with acute appendicitis have signs and symptoms consistent with ileus or bowel obstruction. Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, nausea and vomiting are common. The reported rate of the presence of fever ranges from 30 to 80%. However, only a minority of the patients has all of typical signs and symptoms together.
According to other authors, appendicitis does not present atypically in older patients. On the contrary, symptoms and signs reflect the severity of the abdominal disease, the delay of hospital admission and the high rate of perforations. Indeed, significantly more signs and symptoms of peritonitis (abdominal distension, generalised tenderness and guarding, rebound tenderness, palpable abdominal mass) are recorded among older patients. Probably, comorbidity and concurrent medication may further complicate the diagnosis. Statement 2. In elderly population, we recommend against basing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis only on patient's clinical signs and symptoms (Strong recommendation, low quality evidence).

## Have laboratory tests sufficient diagnostic accuracy
for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in elderly patients?
According to , in general population, appendicitis is likely when two or more inflammatory variables are increased and unlikely when all are normal. Furthermore, Yu et al.found that procalcitonin has great diagnostic value in identifying complicated appendicitis (AUC value 0.94).
However, according to some studies, laboratory tests have no sufficient diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in elderly patients. On the contrary, other studies showed as leukocyte response is not affected by age, and a significantly greater proportion of older patients had a raised white cell count compared with younger patients.
In a series of 83 consecutive elderly patients operated on for a clinical suspicion of acute appendicitis, although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, unelevated values excluded it with a 100% negative predictive value.
According to some studies, a high CRP value in elderly patients with acute appendicitis, could be a suspect index for the existence of a perforation (AUC 0.811 with the cut-off of 101.9 mg/l). Shin et al. showed, as the delta neutrophil index, that measures of the fraction of immature granulocytes in the circulation is the only independent marker that can significantly predict the presence of perforation in multiple regressions in elderly patients. Statement 3. We recommend against basing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in elderly patients only on elevated leukocytes count and CRP value. It should prompt adequate diagnostic course (Strong recommendation, low quality evidence).
4. What is the optimum pathway for imaging in elderly patients with suspected acute appendicitis? CT or US or both?
When recommending the choice of the imaging strategy, the patients' age and the potential radiation exposure are important. Although a careful balance of risk-benefit ratio is needed, routine use of CT scan with intravenous (IV) contrast has been demonstrated to be associated with lower negative appendectomy rates. US is inferior to CT in sensitivity and in negative predictive value for appendicitis and may not be as useful for excluding appendicitis. This is particularly true if the appendix is not visualised. False negatives with US are also more likely in patients with a ruptured appendix. Even if, according to Shchatsko et al., the sensitivity of CT scan with IV contrast in diagnosis of acute appendicitis among elderly patients is lower than among general population, CT sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for acute appendicitis in patients older than 65 years old reported by other authors are 100%, 99.1%, 95.7% and 100%, respectively.
Taking into account that complication rate in elderly patients with negative appendectomy is significantly higher than in younger patients (25% vs 3%, p < 0.05), the pre-operative diagnosis in th

## Should laparoscopic appendectomy be preferred over open appendectomy for elderly patients with acute appendicitis?
When technical skill and equipment are available laparoscopy appendectomy has become the preferred approach to acute appendicitis; guidelines for adult patients recommend the laparoscopic approach in all patients, even in case of complicated acute appendicitis. A recent meta-analysis showed that laparoscopy is associated with longer operative times and higher operative costs, but it leads to less post-operative pain, less surgical site infections, shorter length of stay (LOS) and earlier return to work and physical activity.
Several studies investigated the role of laparoscopy in elderly patients, although the definition of elderly patient was not clear. The analysis of the literature available dedicated to elderly patients gave contrasting results with no
