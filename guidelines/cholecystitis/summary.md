7.2 In complicated ACC, we recommend prescribing the antimicrobial regimen based on the presumed pathogens involved and the risk factors for major resistance patterns. #QoE: high; SoR: strong# Empiric antibiotic treatment should be commenced according to the most frequently isolated microorganisms, taking into consideration the local trends of antibiotic resistance and the availability of drugs.

## Conclusions, knowledge gaps and research recommendations
The WSES 2020 on ACC, based on the updated evidence, reinforces the pivotal role of ELC in the management of ACC, even in high-risk patients. The new developed algorithm, in our opinion, emphasizes the importance of two categories of patients: the high-risk patients and those who are not suitable for surgery. The CHOCOLATE Study [bib_ref] Laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus percutaneous catheter drainage for acute cholecystitis in high risk..., Loozen [/bib_ref] defined high-risk patients as those with an APACHE score 7-14; this high-quality study improved our understanding of the management of this complex cohort of patients. Its results are in favour of surgery, when compared with biliary drainage in high-risk patients with ACC. However, there is not a single and universally accepted definition of this high-risk patients group; therefore, accepting the suggestion coming from Loozen et al., it appears reasonable to recommend the development of local clinical pathways after deciding which of the available scores fits local needs and expertise.
In addition to the defined high-risk patients, the WSES proposes the category of patients who are not suitable for surgery. We suggest to include in this group all patients with ACC who are not fit for surgery, according to the specific surgeon's judgement, and patients who are not amenable for surgical treatment, due to the presence of clinical conditions which are not classifiable with clinical or physiologic scores (Appendix 2). For this cohort of patients, surgery may be unsafe or impossible and gallbladder drainage may be the best suitable option in case of uncontrolled sepsis and/or failure of NOM.
Moreover, areas for important future research were identified. These include (1) high-quality studies on prognostic factors of ACC patients so as to improve shared decision making, (2) defining the best management option when ELC is not possible due to lack of surgical expertise or due to the duration of symptoms. This should include focus groups involving patients and clinicians, and using observational studies, and (3) defining the best option in the management of difficult operative scenarios. This needs a common language among researchers in order to obtain higher quality studies (in terms of classification of difficulties: e.g. adhesions with hollow viscus, difficulties in grasping the gallbladder, difficulties in view of safety, gangrene of the cystic duct, etc.).
Finally, the WSES strongly advocates the adoption of a policy for safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy and encourages the development of local pathways, based on the available evidence.

## Tokyo Guidelines: Diagnostic Criteria
*Diagnostic criteria and severity assessment of acute cholecystitis: Tokyo Guidelines* (pubmed)

## Diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis
Diagnosis is the starting point of the management of acute cholecystitis, and prompt and timely diagnosis should lead to early treatment and lower mortality and morbidity. Specifi c diagnostic criteria are necessary to accurately diagnose typical, as well as atypical cases. The Guidelines propose diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis [fig_ref] Table 1: Diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis Imaging fi ndings [/fig_ref]. C-reactive protein (CRP) is not commonly measured in many countries. However, because acute cholecystitis is usually associatied with an elevation of CRP level by 3 mg/dl or more, CRP was included. Diagnosis of acute cholecystitis by elevation of CRP level (3 mg/dl or more), with ultrasonographic fi ndings suggesting acute cholecystitis, has a sensitivity of 97%, specifi city of 76%, and positive predictive value of 95% (level 1b). [bib_ref] Diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography and C-reactive protein concentration in acute cholecystitis: a..., Juvonen [/bib_ref] After the discussion during the Tokyo International Consensus Meeting, almost unanimous agreement was achieved on the criteria [fig_ref] Table 2: Answer pad responses on the diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis [/fig_ref]. However, 19% of the panelists from abroad expressed the necessity for minor modifi cations, because, in the provisional version, the diagnostic criteria did not include technetium hepatobiliery iminodiacetic acid (Tc-HIDA) scan as an item.

## Imaging fi ndings of acute cholecystitis
Ultrasonography fi ndings (level 4) 2-5 Sonographic Murphy sign (tenderness elicited by pressing the gallbladder with the ultrasound probe) Thickened gallbladder wall (>4 mm; if the patient does not have chronic liver disease and/or ascites or right heart failure) Enlarged gallbladder (long axis diameter >8 cm, short axis diameter >4 cm) Incarcerated gallstone, debris echo, pericholecystic fl uid collection Sonolucent layer in the gallbladder wall, striated intramural lucencies, and Doppler signals.

## Concept of severity grading of acute cholecystitis
Patients with acute cholecystitis may present with a spectrum of disease stages ranging from a mild, self-limited illness to a fulminant, potentially lifethreatening illness. In these Guidelines we classify the severity of acute cholecystitis into the following three categories: "mild (grade I)", "moderate (grade II)", and "severe (grade III)". A category for the most severe grade of acute cholecystitis is needed because this grade requires intensive care and urgent treatment (operation and/or drainage) to save the patient's life. However, the vast majority of patients present with less severe forms of the disease. In these patients, the major practical question regarding management is whether it is advisable to perform cholecystectomy at the time of presentation in the acute phase or whether other strategies of management should be chosen during the acute phase, followed by an interval cholecystectomy. Therefore, to guide the clinician, the severity grading includes a "moderate" group based on criteria predicting when conditions might be unfavorable for cholecystectomy in the acute phase (level 2b-4). [bib_ref] Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis: can the need for conversion and the..., Brodsky [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Conversion factors in laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis, Teixeira [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis: how do fever and leucocytosis relate to..., Halachmi [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Laparoscopic versus open cholecystectomy for cholecystitis (200 cases).

Defi nitions of the three grades are given below.

## Mild (grade i) acute cholecystitis
Mild acute cholecystitis occurs in a patient in whom there are no fi ndings of organ dysfunction, and there is mild disease in the gallbladder, allowing for cholecystectomy to be performed as a safe and low-risk procedure. These patients do not have a severity index that meets the criteria for "moderate (grade II)" or "severe (grade III)" acute cholecystitis.

## Moderate (grade ii) acute cholecystitis
In moderate acute cholecystitis, the degree of acute infl ammation is likely to be associated with increased operative diffi culty to perform a cholecystectomy (level 2b-4). [bib_ref]

## Tokyo Guidelines: Revised Criteria
*New diagnostic criteria and severity assessment of acute cholecystitis in revised Tokyo guidelines* (pubmed)

## Assessment of tg07 diagnostic criteria and severity assessment criteria for acute cholecystitis
The 451 patients who were operated on for cholecystectomy comprised 255 male patients and 196 female patients with a mean age of 63.9 ± 14.0 years. 227 of the 451 patients enrolled were given a final pathological diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The prevalence of acute cholecystitis in the cohort was 50.3 %. Based on the diagnostic criteria in TG07, a definite diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was made in 224 patients. Diagnostic criteria were not met in the remaining 227 patients.
We constructed 2 9 2 contingency tables between pathologically proven acute cholecystitis and acute cholecystitis diagnosed by TG07 criteria. There were 209 truepositive cases, 15 false-positive cases, 18 false-negative cases, and 209 true-negative cases [fig_ref] Table 3 2 9: 2 contingency tables of multi-center analysis for diagnostic criteria of TG07 [/fig_ref]. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of TG07 were 92.1 % (209/227) and 93.3 % (209/224), respectively; the falsenegative and false-positive rates were 7.9 % (18/227) and 6.7 % (15/224), respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 93.3 and 92.1 %, respectively, and the positive and negative likelihood ratios were 13.75 and 0.08, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy was 92.7 %.
In terms of severity assessment, a total of 227 patients who were given a final pathological diagnosis of acute cholecystitis were retrospectively examined with TG07 severity assessment criteria for acute cholecystitis. Of them, 111 patients were classified as Grade I (48.9 %), 104 patients as Grade II (45.8 %), and 12 patients as Grade III (5.3 %), respectively.
Revision of TG07 diagnostic criteria and severity assessment criteria for acute cholecystitis Several problems regarding the TG07 diagnostic criteria and severity assessment system were found during the analysis. The most important problem in TG07 was that the criteria for definite diagnosis were ambiguous and difficult to use. In TG07, there were two categories determining the definite diagnosis of acute cholecystitis [fig_ref] Table 1: TG07 diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis A [/fig_ref]. Definite diagnosis 1: To obtain a definite diagnosis one item in A and one item in B had to be positive. Definite diagnosis 2: Imaging findings (Criterion C) confirmed the diagnosis when acute cholecystitis was suspected clinically. The Tokyo Guidelines Revision Committee concluded that the term ''definite diagnosis'' could not be supported in current practice without positive diagnostic imaging studies.
For acute cholecystitis, abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA scan) are the imaging studies most commonly used in diagnosis. In particular, ultrasonography is a test that should be performed first of all in every case for which acute cholecystectomy is suspected. Sonography should be the screening test of ch

## Assessment of tg13 diagnostic criteria and severity assessment for acute cholecystitis
Of 227 patients with a definite diagnosis of acute cholecystitis based on the proposed new diagnostic criteria, a final diagnosis of acute cholecystitis by pathology was made in 207 patients. We constructed 2 9 2 contingency tables between patients with acute cholecystitis by pathology and the cases with definite diagnosis using the proposed new diagnostic criteria, with 207 true-positive cases, 7 false-positive cases, 20 false-negative cases, and 217 true-negative cases [fig_ref] Table 7 2 9: 2 contingency tables of multi-center analysis for definite diagnosis of TG13... [/fig_ref].
The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of definite diagnosis were 91.2 % (207/227) and 96.9 % (217/224), respectively. The false-negative and false-positive rates were 8.8 % (20/227) and 3.1 % (7/224), respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 96.7 and 91.6 %, respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 29.18 and 0.09, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy was 94.0 %. On the other hand, of the 219 patients with a suspected or definite diagnosis of acute cholecystitis based on the proposed new diagnostic criteria, a final diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was made in 208 patients. We constructed 2 9 2 contingency tables between patients with acute cholecystitis by pathology and the cases with suspected or definite diagnosis using the proposed new diagnostic criteria, with 208 true-positive cases, 11 false-positive cases, 19 false-negative cases, and 213 truenegative cases . The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of suspected or definite diagnosis were 91.6 % (208/227) and 95.1 % (213/224), respectively. The falsenegative and false-positive rates were 8.4 % (19/227) and 4.9 % (11/224), respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 95.0 and 91.8 %, respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 18.66 and 0.09, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy was 93.3 %.
From those results the diagnostic validities were compared between the definite diagnosis of TG07 and that of the proposed new diagnostic criteria [fig_ref] Table 9: Comparison of TG07 and TG13 criteria for acute cholecystitis [/fig_ref].
This comparison of the two diagnostic criteria in terms of diagnostic precision shows that the proposed new diagnostic criteria achieved better performance than TG07. These diagnostic criteria have therefore been chosen as the new diagnostic criteria of acute cholecystitis referred to as the Tokyo Guidelines (TG13).
On the other hand, the TG07 severity assessment criteria for acute cholecystitis did not have significant problems that required major revision of the definitions or structures. The TG07 severity assessment criteria have been adopted.

## Q1. when is the optimal time for cholecystectomy in acute cholecystitis?
the gallbladder in patients with acute cholecystitis, and the results have indicated that laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed during the fi rst admission was associated with a shorter hospital stay, quicker recovery, and reduction in overall cost of treatment compared to open cholecystectomy. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is now accepted to be suffi ciently safe for routine use, because earlier reports of increased risk of bile duct injury (level 4) [bib_ref] Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis: is it really safe?, Kum [/bib_ref] have not been substantiated by more recent experience (level 1b).

These results indicate that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is preferable in patients with acute cholecystitis.
However, the fact that the above trials excluded patients with pan-peritonitis caused by perforation of the gallbladder, patients with common bile duct stones, and those with concomitant severe cardiopulmonary disease should be borne in mind when evaluating the results.
After evaluation of patients' overall condition and confi rmation of the diagnosis by ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and/or magnetic resonance cholargio-parcreatography (MRCP), the timing of the surgical management of acute cholecystitis patients should be immediately decided by experienced surgeons (level 5).

## Cholecystectomy is preferable early after admission (recommendation a).
Randomized controlled trials in the open cholecystectomy era, comparing early surgery with delayed surgery in the 1970s-1980s, found that early surgery had the advantages of less blood loss, a shorter operation time, a lower complication rate, and a briefer hospital stay (level 1b) 1-3,12 (level 3b).

## Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is preferable to open cholecystectomy (recommendation a).
Cholecystectomy has been widely performed to treat acute cholecystitis, with laparoscopic cholecystectomy having been increasingly adopted over the past 10 years. Several reports of complications associated with early laparoscopic cholecystectomy caused a transient wane in the enthusiasm for early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (level 4), [bib_ref] Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis: is it really safe?, Kum [/bib_ref] (level 2b), 17 (level 4), [bib_ref] Management of major biliary complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, Branum [/bib_ref] ,19 but such concerns were allayed by evidence indicating that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for patients with acute cholecystitis was safe and effective, and required a shorter hospitalization time (level 1b) [bib_ref] Randomized trial of laparoscopic versus open cholecystectomy for acute and gangrenous cholecystitis, Kiviluoto [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Laparoscopic versus open cholecystectomy: hospitalization, sick leave, analgesia and trauma responses, Berrgren [/bib_ref] (level 2b) [bib_ref] A populationbased cohort study comparing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and open cholecystectomy, Zacks [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] The Baltimore experience with laparoscopic management of acute cholecystitis, Flowers [/bib_ref] (level 3b) [bib_ref] Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis: prospective trial, Eldar [/bib_ref] (level 4). [bib_ref] Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute infl ammation of the gallbladder, Cox [/bib_ref] Treatment of acute cholecystitis essentially consists of early cholecystectomy, and the optimal surgical treatment for each grade of severity of acute cholecystitis is required. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is indicated for patients with mild (grade I) acute cholecystitis, because laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed in most these patients. Early laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy (within 72 h of the onset of acute cholecystitis) is generally required for patients with moderate (grade II) acute cholecystitis, but in some patients with moderate (grade II) acute cholecystitis, it is diffi cult to remove the gallbladder surgically, because of severe infl ammation limited to the gallbladder. The severe local infl ammation of the gallbladder is evaluated according to factors such as more than 72 h from the onset, wall thickness of the gallbladder of more than 8 mm, and a WBC count of more than 18 000. Continuous medical treatment or drainage of the contents of a swollen gallbladder by percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD) or surgical cholecystostomy is the optimal treatment, with delayed cholecystectomy indicated after the infl ammation of the gallbladder resolves. Urgent management of severe (grade III) acute cholecystitis is always necessary, because the patients have organ dysfunction, and drainage of the gallbladder contents and/or cholecyste

## NICE: Gallstone Disease
*Gallstone disease: diagnosis and management* (nice)

Gallstone disease: diagnosis and management

This guideline covers diagnosing and managing gallstone disease in adults. It aims to reduce variation in care by promoting the most effective treatments, and to improve the advice given to people with gallstone disease before and after treatment.

# Introduction
Gallstone disease occurs when hard fatty or mineral deposits (gallstones) form in the gallbladder. Approximately 15% of the adult population are thought to have gallstone disease, and most of these people experience no symptoms. For a small proportion of people with gallstone disease, the stones irritate the gallbladder or block part of the biliary system, and this can cause symptoms such as pain, infection and inflammation. If these symptoms are left untreated, gallstones can cause more serious and in some cases life‑threatening conditions such as cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis and jaundice.
There is variation in how gallstone disease is managed. Some people with symptomless gallstone disease are offered treatment to prevent symptoms developing in the future, whereas others are offered a watch‑and‑wait approach. When people experience symptoms of gallstone disease they often need surgery to remove their gallbladder. There is uncertainty about the best way of treating gallstone disease. In addition, if surgery is appropriate there is uncertainty about whether it should be performed as soon as possible after a gallstones attack or delayed until any infection and inflammation has subsided.
This guideline addresses some of these uncertainties and provides recommendations about how gallstone disease should be identified, diagnosed and managed in adults.# Recommendations
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care, as described in making decisions about your care.
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.

# Diagnosing gallstone disease
Offer liver function tests and ultrasound to people with suspected gallstone disease, and to people with abdominal or gastrointestinal symptoms that have been unresponsive to previous management.
Consider magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) if ultrasound has not detected common bile duct stones but the:
bile duct is dilated and/or
liver function test results are abnormal.
Consider endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) if MRCP does not allow a diagnosis to be made.
Refer people for further investigations if conditions other than gallstone disease are suspected.

# Managing gallbladder stones
Reassure people with asymptomatic gallbladder stones found in a normal gallbladder and normal biliary tree that they do not need treatment unless they develop symptoms.
Offer laparoscopic cholecystectomy to people diagnosed with symptomatic gallbladder stones.
Offer day‑case laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people having it as an elective planned procedure, unless their circumstances or clinical condition make an inpatient stay necessary.
Offer early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (to be carried out within 1 week of diagnosis) to people with acute cholecystitis.
Offer percutaneous cholecystostomy to manage gallbladder empyema when:
surgery is contraindicated at presentation and
conservative management is unsuccessful.
Reconsider laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people who have had percutaneous cholecystostomy once they are well enough for surgery.

# Managing common bile duct stones
Offer bile duct clearance and laparoscopic cholecystectomy to people with symptomatic or asymptomatic common bile duct stones.
Clear the bile duct:
surgically at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy or
with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) before or at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
If the bile duct cannot be cleared with ERCP, use biliary stenting to achieve biliary drainage only as a temporary measure until definitive endoscopic or surgical clearance.
Use the lowest‑cost option suitable for the clinical situation when choosing between day‑case and inpatient procedures for elective ERCP.

# Patient, family member and carer information
Advise people to avoid food and drink that triggers their symptoms until they have their gallbladder or gallstones removed.
Advise people that they should not need to avoid food and drink that triggered their symptoms after they have their gallbladder or gallstones removed.
Advise people to seek further advice from their GP if eating or drinking triggers existing symptoms or causes new symptoms to develop after they have recovered from having their gallbladder or gallstones removed.

# Terms used in this guideline

## Asymptomatic gallstones/ asymptomatic common bile duct stones
Stones that are found incidentally, as a result of imaging investigations unrelated to gallstone disease in people who have been completely symptom free for at least 12 months before diagnosis.

## Gallbladder empyema
Build‑up of pus in the gallbladder, as a result of a blocked cystic duct.

## Laparoscopic cholecystectomy
Removal of the gallbladder through 'keyhole' surgery.

## Percutaneous cholecystostomy
A procedure to drain pus and fluid from an infected gallbladder.

## Symptomatic gallstones/ symptomatic common bile duct stones
Stones found on gallbladder imaging, regardless of whether symptoms are being experienced currently or whether they occurred sometime in the 12 months before diagnosis.# Research recommendations
The Guideline Development Group has made the following recommendations for research, based on its review of evidence, to improve NICE guidance and patient care in the future.
