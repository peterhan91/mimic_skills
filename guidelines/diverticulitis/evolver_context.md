## Clinical Guidelines: Diverticulitis

### WSES 2020

## Should antibiotics be recommended in immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis?
In immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis without signs of systemic inflammation, we recommend to not prescribe antibiotic therapy (strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A).
In patients requiring antibiotic therapy, we recommend oral administration whenever possible, primarily, because an early switch from intravenous to oral therapy may facilitate a shorter inpatient length of stay (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B).
The definition of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is often vague and poorly defined. Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is defined as localized diverticular inflammation without any abscess or perforation. A universally accepted classification divides intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) into complicated and uncomplicated [bib_ref] The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines..., Sartelli [/bib_ref]. In uncomplicated IAIs, the infection only involves a single organ and does not extend to the peritoneum, while in complicated IAIs, the infectious process extends beyond the organ, causing either localized or diffuse peritonitis [bib_ref] The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines..., Sartelli [/bib_ref]. For a better definition of acute diverticulitis in these guidelines, we use the term complicated a

# Recommendations
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care, as described in your care.
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.

## Management and advice
Tell people with diverticulosis that the condition is asymptomatic and no specific treatments are needed.
Advise people to eat a healthy, balanced diet including whole grains, fruit and vegetables. Tell them that:
there is no need to avoid seeds, nuts, popcorn or fruit skins
if they have constipation and a low-fibre diet, increasing their fibre intake gradually may minimise flatulence and bloating.
Advise people to drink adequate fluid if they are increasing their fibre intake, especially if there is a risk of dehydration.
Consider bulk-forming laxatives for people with constipation.
Tell people about the benefits of exercise, and weight loss if they are overweight or obese, and stopping smoking, in reducing the risk of developing acute diverticulitis and symptomatic disease.
