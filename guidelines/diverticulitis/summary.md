## Should antibiotics be recommended in immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis?
In immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis without signs of systemic inflammation, we recommend to not prescribe antibiotic therapy (strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A).
In patients requiring antibiotic therapy, we recommend oral administration whenever possible, primarily, because an early switch from intravenous to oral therapy may facilitate a shorter inpatient length of stay (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B).
The definition of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is often vague and poorly defined. Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is defined as localized diverticular inflammation without any abscess or perforation. A universally accepted classification divides intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) into complicated and uncomplicated [bib_ref] The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines..., Sartelli [/bib_ref]. In uncomplicated IAIs, the infection only involves a single organ and does not extend to the peritoneum, while in complicated IAIs, the infectious process extends beyond the organ, causing either localized or diffuse peritonitis [bib_ref] The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines..., Sartelli [/bib_ref]. For a better definition of acute diverticulitis in these guidelines, we use the term complicated and uncomplicated according to the classification of IAIs.
Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is an anatomically confined inflammatory process. CT findings include diverticula, thickening of the wall, and increased density of the pericolic fat. Patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis usually have an indolent course with a low incidence of subsequent complications.
The utility of antibiotics in acute uncomplicated acute diverticulitis has been a point of controversy. In recent years, several studies demonstrated that antimicrobial treatment was not superior to withholding antibiotic therapy, in terms of clinical resolution, in patients with mild unperforated diverticulitis [bib_ref] Antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis, Shabanzadeh [/bib_ref]. The current consensus is that uncomplicated acute diverticulitis may be a self-limiting condition in which local host defenses can manage the inflammation without antibiotics in immunocompetent patients. In this context, antibiotics are not necessary in the treatment of uncomplicated disease.
A multicenter randomized trial was published in 2012 by Chabok et al. involving ten surgical departments in Sweden and one in Iceland recruiting 623 patients with computed tomography-confirmed acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis [bib_ref] Randomized clinical trial of antibiotics in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, Chabok [/bib_ref]. Patients were randomized to treatment with (314 patients) or without (309 patients) antibiotics

## NICE: Diverticular Disease
*Diverticular disease: diagnosis and management* (nice)

# Recommendations
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care, as described in your care.
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.

## Management and advice
Tell people with diverticulosis that the condition is asymptomatic and no specific treatments are needed.
Advise people to eat a healthy, balanced diet including whole grains, fruit and vegetables. Tell them that:
there is no need to avoid seeds, nuts, popcorn or fruit skins
if they have constipation and a low-fibre diet, increasing their fibre intake gradually may minimise flatulence and bloating.
Advise people to drink adequate fluid if they are increasing their fibre intake, especially if there is a risk of dehydration.
Consider bulk-forming laxatives for people with constipation.
Tell people about the benefits of exercise, and weight loss if they are overweight or obese, and stopping smoking, in reducing the risk of developing acute diverticulitis and symptomatic disease.

## Management and advice
Do not offer antibiotics to people with diverticular disease.
Advise people to avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid analgesia if possible, because they may increase the risk of diverticular perforation.
For advice on diet, fluid intake, stopping smoking, weight loss and exercise, follow the recommendations in section 1.1 on diverticulosis.
Advise people that:
the benefits of increasing dietary fibre may take several weeks to achieve
if tolerated, a high-fibre diet should be maintained for life.
Consider bulk-forming laxatives if:
a high-fibre diet is unacceptable to the person or it is not tolerated or
the person has persistent constipation or diarrhoea.
Consider simple analgesia, for example paracetamol, as needed if the person has ongoing abdominal pain.
Consider an antispasmodic if the person has abdominal cramping.
If the person has persistent symptoms or symptoms that do not respond to treatment, think about alternative causes and investigate and manage appropriately.

## Symptoms and signs of acute diverticulitis
Suspect acute diverticulitis if a person presents with constant abdominal pain, usually severe and localising in the left lower quadrant, with any of the following:
fever or
sudden change in bowel habit and significant rectal bleeding or passage of mucus from the rectum or
tenderness in the left lower quadrant, a palpable abdominal mass or distention on abdominal examination, with a previous history of diverticulosis or diverticulitis. Be aware that in a minority of people and in people of Asian origin, pain and tenderness may be localised in the right lower quadrant.

## Symptoms and signs of complicated acute diverticulitis
Suspect complicated acute diverticulitis and refer for same-day hospital assessment if the person has uncontrolled abdominal pain and any of the features in table 1.
Symptom or sign
Possible complication
Abdominal mass on examination or peri-rectal fullness on digital rectal examination
Intra-abdominal abscess
Abdominal rigidity and guarding on examination
Bowel perforation and peritonitis
Altered mental state, raised respiratory rate, low systolic blood pressure, raised heart rate, low tympanic temperature, no urine output or skin discolouration
Sepsis (see the NICE guideline on sepsis)
Faecaluria, pneumaturia, pyuria or the passage of faeces through the vagina
Fistula into the bladder or vagina
Colicky abdominal pain, absolute constipation (passage of no flatus or stool), vomiting or abdominal distention
Intestinal obstruction

## Investigation of suspected acute diverticulitis
For people with suspected uncomplicated acute diverticulitis who are not referred for same-day hospital assessment:
reassess in primary care if their symptoms persist or worsen and
consider referral to secondary care for further assessment.
For people with suspected complicated acute diverticulitis who have been referred for same-day hospital assessment, offer a full blood count, urea and electrolytes test and C‑reactive protein test.
If the person with suspected complicated acute diverticulitis has raised inflammatory markers, offer a contrast CT scan within 24 hours of hospital admission to confirm diagnosis and help plan management. If contrast CT is contraindicated, perform one of the following:
a non-contrast CT or
an MRI or
an ultrasound scan, depending on local expertise.
If inflammatory markers are not raised, think about the possibility of alternative diagnoses.

## Non-surgical management of acute diverticulitis
For people with acute diverticulitis who are systemically well:
consider a no antibiotic prescribing strategy
-ffer simple analgesia, for example paracetamol
advise the person to re‑present if symptoms persist or worsen.
Offer an antibiotic pres
