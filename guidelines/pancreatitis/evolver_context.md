# Recommendations
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your care.
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.

# Acute pancreatitis
People with acute pancreatitis usually present with sudden-onset abdominal pain. Nausea and vomiting are often present and there may be a history of gallstones or excessive alcohol intake. Typical physical signs include epigastric tenderness, fever and tachycardia. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed by testing blood lipase or amylase levels, which are usually raised. If raised levels are not found, abdominal CT may confirm pancreatic inflammation.

## Referral for specialist treatment
If a person develops necrotic, infective, haemorrhagic or systemic complications of acute pancreatitis:
seek advice from a specialist pancreatic centre within the referral network and
discuss whether to move the person to the specialist centre for treatment of the complications.
When managing acute pancreatitis in children:
seek advice from a paediatric gastroenterology or hepatology unit and a specialist pancreatic centre and
discuss whether to move the child to the specialist c

### JPN: Diagnostic Criteria

## It is essential to interview all patients (including those with consciousness disorders or who are in a state of shock), take their medical histories, and perform a physical examination (recommendation a)
Abdominal pain, pain radiating to the back, anorexia, fever, nausea and vomiting, and decreased bowel sounds are frequent manifestations of acute pancreatitis (Tables 1 and 2) (Level 4). 1,2 However, these features are not specific to acute pancreatitis, and when a patient presents with these manifestations, acute pancreatitis must be differentiated from other acute abdominal diseases. Acute pancreatitis accounts for 2% to 3% of all acute abdominal diseases (Level 2b, unknown) 3,4 and in a very few patients there is no abdominal pain (Level 2b). 5 tis are 85% to 100% and 84.7% to 99.0% (Level 2a), [bib_ref] Lipase and pancreatic amylase activities in tissues and in patients with hyperamylasemia, Apple [/bib_ref] respectively. The blood lipase value is more sensitive than blood amylase (Levels 2b-4) 11-13 and provides diagnostic capability similar to that of blood P-amylase (Level 2b). [bib_ref] Normal amylase levels in the presentation of acute pancreatitis, Orebaugh [/bib_ref] Blood lipase is considered a valuable diagnostic tool, because abnormally high values persist for longer than abnormal blood amylase levels (Level 2b), [bib_ref] Serum lipase: a better test to diagnose acute alcoholic pancreatitis, Gumaste [/bib_ref] and it is more sensitive in terms of detecting t

### JPN: Severity Assessment

## Severity assessment is essential to the selection of appropriate initial treatment. even acute pancreatitis that is initially diagnosed as mild or moderate may quickly progress to severe, and continuous assessment is required, particularly during the first 3 days after onset (recommendation a)
To improve the survival rate in patients with acute pancreatitis, severity assessment during the initial examination is extremely important to ensure the quick and accurate diagnosis of severe cases (which have a high mortality rate), to commence appropriate initial treatment, and, if necessary, to transfer the patient to an advanced specialist medical institution. Because quite a few cases initially diagnosed as mild acute pancreatitis may progress to severe acute pancreatitis, serial assessments of severity should be performed. It is
