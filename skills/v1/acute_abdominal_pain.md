# Systematic Approach to Acute Abdominal Pain

## Step 1: Physical Examination First
**ALWAYS start with physical examination before any testing.**
- Assess vital signs for hemodynamic instability or fever
- Perform focused abdominal exam: inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation
- Check for peritoneal signs (rebound, rigidity, guarding)
- Test specific signs based on pain location (Murphy's sign for RUQ pain, McBurney's point for RLQ)
- Document pain character, location, radiation patterns

## Step 2: Laboratory Testing Based on Exam Findings
**Order labs selectively based on physical findings, not routinely:**
- If peritoneal signs present: CBC with differential, basic metabolic panel
- If RUQ tenderness with positive Murphy's sign: Add liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase)
- If significant systemic illness appearance: Include lactate, coagulation studies
- **Key principle:** Normal lab values do not exclude surgical pathology

## Step 3: Imaging Selection by Anatomic Location
**Choose imaging based on suspected pathology location from exam:**
- RUQ pain with Murphy's sign: Abdominal ultrasound first-line
- Generalized peritonitis or trauma: CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast
- If ultrasound unavailable or inconclusive: CT abdomen/pelvis
- **Avoid shotgun imaging** - target the anatomically suspected area

## Step 4: Diagnostic Integration
**Synthesize findings systematically:**
- Correlate exam findings with imaging results
- Consider surgical vs medical etiology based on:
  - Presence of peritoneal signs
  - Imaging evidence of acute pathology
  - Patient's hemodynamic status
- **Remember:** Classic presentations may be atypical, especially in elderly

## Step 5: Treatment Decision
**Base management on combined clinical picture:**
- Surgical consultation for: positive peritoneal signs, imaging showing acute surgical pathology, hemodynamic instability
- Medical management for: isolated pain without peritoneal signs, normal imaging
- **Bridge therapy:** IV antibiotics, pain control, NPO status while awaiting definitive management
